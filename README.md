# foundation-react

A public library containing a collection of `react hooks` and other convenient methods I use in all my web development related projects. 
I periodically add new hooks and refactor my code if I find a better way to improve my code.

#### Foundation hooks

You can find the non-ui related hooks [here](https://github.com/SergeiMeza/foundation-react/tree/main/src/lib/hooks/foundation).

#### UI hooks

Additionally, you can find the ui related hooks [here](https://github.com/SergeiMeza/foundation-react/tree/main/src/lib/hooks/ui).

#### React.js (Next.js) related utils

You can find convenient methods when implementing a react application in Next.js [here](https://github.com/SergeiMeza/foundation-react/tree/main/src/lib/utils).
